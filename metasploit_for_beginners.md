#### All right, first things first. If you haven't updated Metasploit run:

```

```

#### Next to start Metasploit run:

```
msfconsole
```

#### Metasploit should start at this point and after the programme spins up you should see the below where your command line used to be:

```
msf6 >
```

#### Now for the commands

```
help
```

```
